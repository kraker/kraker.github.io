## Web-hosting

### What domain registrar should I use?

1. [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/)i
2. [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com/)

My favorite domain registrar is [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). I've
never had any issues with them and they have good support. I've been using them
for years. The biggest selling point for me is my clients can add me as an 
"administrator" of domains they purchased on namecheap and I can manage all of 
the domains I'm an "admin" for in one interface. It's really handy for me.

[Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) wasn't around when I purchased my first domain 
or I might have used them, but a lot of my friends from the web-hosting industry 
really like this registrar. Comes with an extra helping of hipster cred. 
Probably a good choice if you're a web designer who likes to use
[hipster ipsum](https://hipsum.co/).

### Where should I host my website?

1. [squarespace.com](https://www.squarespace.com/)
