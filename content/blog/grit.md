I recently learned that the greatest predictor of success in an endeavor is not
anything you would typically think. It's not IQ, socioeconomic status... whether
you grew up rich or poor, or whether you had good parents. Actually, it's a
difficult to define quality called _grit_.

To give an example, with enough grit you can overcome all odds and become a navy
seal. Just take a look at [David Goggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goggins).
I'm paraphrasing, but he came from a racist part of Alabama. He grew up poor.
His father was abusive. He was overweight. He had just about every reason not to
succeed. The one thing he did seem to have was _grit_. If anyone has _grit_,
it's this guy.  He's a certifiable badass. But he didn't get there overnight. 

I recently stumbled across this 
[Ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)
by Angela Duckworth about this topic. Her research shows that just
about the only significant predictor of success is having _grit_. It wasn't IQ,
looks, upbringing, or any of the other commonly assumed _predictors of success._

Grit is having **stamina** and **endurance.** It's being able to weather failures
and difficulties. It's working towards a goal day-in and day-out, over a long
period of time, and not giving up. 

Ok, so how do you build grit?

That's a good question.

There doesn't seem to be an obvious way to become _grittier_. Angela Duckworth
talks about how some of the things that seem to correlate with being gritty are
having a _growth mindset_ and realizing that failures aren't a permanent
condition. It's ok to fail if you learn from your failures. 

A growth mindset is believing that weaknesses can be overcome by applying
yourself and putting the work in. It's the difference between believing that
some people are just talented or smart, or that those things are skills that can
be developed.

Don't get me wrong; talent helps. Some people are more genetically gifted. It's
not an equal playing field. But I think what this shows, is that the gap between
having those _natural_ abilities and having _grit_ is a lot smaller than we
think. There are exceptions.  It's not enough to just have _grit_ if you plan to
be a world-class Olympic swimmer like Michael Phelps. He's a freak of nature
with a crazy wing-span. He has flippers for feet. But he also has grit. Phelps
might have medaled at the Olympics, but I doubt he would hold 
[21 Guinness World Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phelps#Guinness_World_Records)
if he didn't also have the grit to work as hard as he did.

Ok, so being in the top 1% in your field might take both grit and god-given
gifts; if you plan to medal at the Olympics.  But how many people were there who
are just as genetically gifted, or even more so than Phelps and aren't a
household name? That's a good question...there's probably a few of us. I think
the point is, you'll never realize your potential if you don't start having some
grit. 

I guess I'm writing this as much for myself as for those of you who are reading. 
I'm not satisfied with where I've gotten to in my life so far, and I need to
change that. It's going to require hard work, perseverance, dedication, and
sacrifice.  

I'll leave you with a quote from probably one of the hardest working athletes in
football.
